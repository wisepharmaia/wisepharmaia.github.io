Most health advice online feels overwhelming or designed to sell you something. In the internet and information era, the most important is to select the best information. The truth? Improving your health doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated or expensive.  
Here are **5 basic habits**, backed by science, that can truly transform your well-being. And when i say basic, is that they could be the ONLY necessary habits to improve your health.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Go to bed at a fixed time**

Your body loves routine.  
Set an **alarm on your phone for bedtime**, not just for waking up.  
Most smartphones have a *"Bedtime"* or *"Sleep"* feature (you can find it in the clock app).  

Getting enough quality sleep reduces stress, helps regulate weight, and improves focus.  
Start by sleeping **7-8 hours** every night.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Eat fewer calories, not magic supplements**

Forget about fad diets and overpriced pills.  
What really works is **calorie balance**.

Example:  
If your goal is **muscle gain**, calculate your protein needs using this rule of thumb:

1.6 ‚Äì 2.2 grams of protein per kg of body weight daily. 

This can be achieved by having prepared meals in your fridge with chicken meat, eggs, protein milk and others. You don't need to have a lot of protein things, just list the basics and make sure to have them always!

For fat loss, keep calories lower than your energy expenditure, while eating nutritious whole foods.  
You can easily track this in a **Google Sheet** you can open on your phone anytime. I love to have my Google Sheets for calories, finances and more in my phone's Desktop! 

*(Tip: later I‚Äôll share a free calorie calculator sheet you can copy to your own drive).*

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Build a mini home gym**

Most people pay for a gym they rarely use.  
Instead, invest in basic, affordable equipment:  
- A pair of adjustable dumbbells ([example on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=adjustable+dumbbells))  
- Resistance bands  
- A yoga mat  

With these three tools, you can do **90% of effective workouts at home**, saving money and time. There are 5 basics exercises that you need to do:

1. **Squat** ‚Äì The king of lower-body strength, working legs, glutes, and core.  
2. **Deadlift** ‚Äì A full-body move that strengthens your posterior chain (back, hamstrings, glutes).  
3. **Bench Press (or Dumbbell Press)** ‚Äì Push exercise for chest, shoulders, and triceps.  
4. **Overhead Press (Military Press)** ‚Äì Builds strong shoulders and upper body pressing power.  
5. **Pull-up or Row** ‚Äì Essential for a strong back and arms (can be replaced with dumbbell rows at home).

DON'T forget them! Adding more exercises just do the mountain bigger!

*Tip:* Perform these **3‚Äì4 times a week**, 3 sets of 6‚Äì12 reps each, progressively adding weight and/or reps over time for optimal muscle growth. Put this track in a Google Sheet too!

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Drink more water (make it enjoyable)**

Many people are chronically dehydrated.  
To drink more water:  
- Add a slice of **lemon or cucumber** 
- Use natural **stevia-based flavor drops** (check [these safe options on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=stevia+water+flavor))  
- Have a cup of **unsweetened tea or herbal infusions**  

It‚Äôs cheaper, healthier, and better than sugary drinks.

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Check your vitamins instead of guessing**

Low vitamin D, magnesium, or B12 can impact your energy and mood.  
Before buying supplements blindly, ask your doctor for a **simple blood test**.  
Only supplement what you truly need.  
This saves money and avoids unnecessary pills.
